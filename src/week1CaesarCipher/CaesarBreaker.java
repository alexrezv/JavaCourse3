 * Complete the decryption method shown in the lesson by creating a CaesarBreaker class with the methods countLetters,
 * maxIndex, and decrypt. Recall that the decrypt method creates a CaesarCipher object in order to use the encrypt
 * method you wrote for the last lesson. Make sure that your CaesarCipher class is in the same folder as CaesarBreaker!
 * You may want to use the following code as part of your decrypt method.
 * CaesarCipher cc = new CaesarCipher();
 * String message = cc.encrypt(encrypted, 26 - key);
